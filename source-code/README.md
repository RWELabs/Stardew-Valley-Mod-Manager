## About Source Code
This code was constructed for the express purposes of making it easy for my friends to install the modding API and mods with the least amount of drama, issues and need for technical support. This program essentialls just prompts the user for user-specific directories then executes a series of instructions (zipping and unzipping files, creating directories, creating shortcuts, etc.) to ensure a hassle free installation.

I am by no means implying that the code used in this application is efficient, the best or the right way of going about the instructions. It works and it was programmed in an afternoon.

It was compiled with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10. It is a Windows Forms application.
