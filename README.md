# Stardew Valley Mod Manager

The Stardew Valley Mod Manager and Modded Framework is an extension to SMAPI, the open-source modding framework API for Stardew Valley that lets players play the game with mods. Much alike SMAPI, The Stardew Valley Mod Manager does not edit or change any of the core game files and is installed as a completely separate executable to both the main game and the SMAPI launcher. This powerful new application allows you to do a variety of different operations pertaining to mod management and game save management. See "Features" for more information about the different things you can do with the Stardew Valley Mod Manager.

## Features
The Stardew Valley Mod Manager comes with a plethora of features pertaining to mod management and game save management.

1. <b>Installing Mods</b>
Once you have downloaded your mod from NexusMods, all you need to do is open the Stardew Valley Mod Manager, click "Install Mods" then "Add New Mods (.zip)" and select your ZIP file downloaded from NexusMods. Once the Mod Manager has installed your mod, it will be automatically added to your Disabled Mods List, from which you can enable the mod.

2. <b>Uninstalling Mods</b>
Mods can be removed just as easily as they can be installed. Simply disable the mod (if it was enabled) and click the Delete button. Or simply disable the mod and enable it at a later date.

3. <b>Disable and Enable Installed Mods</b>
Have mods be disabled without having to delete them entirely. With a click of a button you can move a mod from disabled to enabled and back to disabled. Disabled mods will remain on your system but will not be active when you launch your modded save.

4. <b>Check Mod Updates (Beta)</b>
With just a few clicks you can check if a compatible mod is currently up to date. Simply open the "Check for Mod Updates [Beta]" window from the Mod Management screen, select your mod and click "Check for Updates". If the mod is compatible, you'll be able to see if the mod is up to date, and if it isn't, get a link to download the new version.*

5. <b>Save and Load Mod Presets</b>
Create mod presets so you can quickly mass enable and disable groups of mods depending on what save you're playing, making mod management that much better. By default, the Stardew Valley Mod Manager comes with a Default preset that includes only SMAPI default mods. Easily revert back to a clean slate with just a few clicks.

6. <b>Modpack Installer</b>
Install entire modpacks with just a single file. Simply install a .sdvmp file and let the Mod Manager find the mods, make sure you're running the minimum SMAPI version or above and even let the program create you a preset with the mods defined for the modpack. It's never been easier to install a collection of mods.

7. <b>Backup and Manage Game Saves</b>
Create backups and delete any of your farms with built in Game Save Management tools.

*Please note that for a mod to be compatible, it must be configured with NexusMod update keys among some other specific criteria. For more information, [click here](https://github.com/RyanWalpoleEnterprises/Stardew-Valley-Mod-Manager/wiki/How-To:-Check-a-Mod-for-Updates-(Beta))

## Documentation
<b>Important:</b> Please note that due to changes in the application's user interface with version 220501, some of the screenshots used in the documentation may be out of date and may not accurately reflect the visual experience you may be having. We believe that despite this, the instructions are still relevant - the appearance and names of labels, windows and user interface may differ but should still adhere closely enough to the written instructions.
