# Stardew Valley Mod Manager
The Stardew Valley Mod Manager and Modded Framework is an extension to SMAPI, the open-source modding framework API for Stardew Valley that lets players play the game with mods. Much alike SMAPI, The Stardew Valley Mod Manager does not edit or change any of the core game files and is installed as a completely separate executable to both the main game and the SMAPI launcher. The Stardew Valley Mod Manager was designed and built with the following functions in mind:

1. <b>Install and Remove Mods</b>
Use the Stardew Valley Mod Manager to quickly install mods from Nexus. Simply select the mod (in .zip file format) and let the Mod Manager do the rest of the work. Similarly, uninstall mods with a single click.

2. <b>Disable and Enable Installed Mods</b>
Have mods be disabled without having to delete them entirely. With a click of a button you can move a mod from disabled to enabled and back to disabled. Disabled mods will remain on your system but will not be active when you launch your modded save.

3. <b>Mod Presets</b>
Create mod presets so you can quickly mass enable and disable groups of mods depending on what save you're playing, making mod management that much better.

4. <b>Quick Modpack Install</b>
Install entire modpacks with just a single file. Simply install the .sdvmp file and let the Mod Manager find the mods, make sure you're running the minimum SMAPI version or above and even let the program create you a preset with the mods defined for the modpack. It's never been easier to install a collection of mods.
